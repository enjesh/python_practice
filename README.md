Learning Python Programming Language
Python is a beginner-friendly programming language, and its structure is often compared to the English language.
Use Python to automate everyday processes, build apps and even create games. The possibilities are endless!!!

## Numbers
1. There are 2 number types
    * int(integer) - whole number no decimal. Can be positive, negative or zero.
    * float - number that contains a decimal point. Can be positive, negative or zero.
2. The type() function tells if the number is an int or float.

## Order of operations
1. PEMDAS
    * Parenthesis
    * Exponents
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Addition
    * Subtraction
2. Not all equations are created equal.
3. Python calculates values from left to right.

Comments in Python start with the hash character (#) and extend to the end of the physical line.

## = sign
Is used to assign a value to a variable.
If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error

## string
In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes.
Python strings cannot be changed — they are immutable.

## list
Lists are a mutable type i.e. it is possible to change their content.
You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append()
