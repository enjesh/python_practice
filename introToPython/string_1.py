# Python starts to count with the number 0! 
# Each character in a string is assigned a position or index
# Index indicates the position of the character in the string
# The last character has an index of â€“1 and python can count backwards.
# Slicing enables you to specify two indexes:
#       (1) where to start looking for characters
#       (2) where to stop looking for characters
#       variable[start:stop]
