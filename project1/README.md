# Project: Meet Your Classmates
Description: 
After a long fun-filled summer break, it’s time to return to school! On the first day of school, your teacher asks the class to go around the room and introduce yourselves to each other.

Although you spent time at the pool and on vacation this summer, you also began to learn a new programming language—Python!

Eager to show off your new skills, you decide to create a Python program that enables your classmates to introduce themselves to the class.

Let’s get started!
