# Project: Shopping for Science Fair Supplies
Description:
Today in class, Alex’s science teacher announced the upcoming science fair. This year, Alex chose to do an experiment on how music affects the growth of plants. After school, her mother took her to the store to buy supplies. However, Alex was given only $25 to complete her experiment. After looking around the store, she found some flowerpots, packs of flower seeds, and bags of soil. Alex wants to use an equation to help her determine the quantity of each supply she could purchase that would be within her budget. The price of each item is as follows:
    • Flowerpot: $4
    • Pack of flower seeds: $1
    • Bag of soil: $5
Create a program using variables and equations that would help Alex determine how much she could purchase for $25. Keep in mind, there is a 6 percent sales tax added to the items in Alex’s shopping cart.
