# Project: Mad Libs Generator
## Description:
* Mad Libs is a game where the reader is asked to provide a series of words that are then used to create a story.
* The stories are often silly as the reader has no clue how their word choices will be used! 
1. Create a Mad Libs generator that prompts you to provide either a noun, an adjective, a verb, or a specific type of word.
2. After you complete all the prompts, the generator uses the words provided to craft a story by inserting the words into a story template.
